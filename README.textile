h2. AssetLoader

Multi file/asset loader for AS3. Tested with Robotlegs, but not dependent on. Alternative to BulkLoader. :P

h3. Overview

AssetLoader provides an easy way to load multiple files. It will automatically link with your Robotlegs shell dispatcher, providing it's events to your application, but it also functions as a "normal" IEventDispatcher so you can use it any project. AssetLoader handles all types of file you may need to load.

h3. Some Features

* Automatic Type detection.
* Multiple connections, which you define.
* Easy to understand Event system.
* Data is dispatched with strong types. NO CASTING!
* Pause/Resume capabilities.
* Consolidated progress.
* Lazy "add" method.
